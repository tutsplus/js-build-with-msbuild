    "text": "In English we tend not to say nouns on their own.  We often surround them all kinds of grammatical elements. For instance, determiners (words like 'the', 'a', 'this' and 'that') can change the meaning a lot.  'Pass me a tissue' is very general, but 'Who left this filthy tissue here?' is much more specific and focused. Here we'll practise building noun phrases correctly."
